    <p> Ask me why my heart's inside my throat
        I've never been in love, I've been alone
        Feel like I've been living life asleep
        Love so strong it makes me feel so weak
        Are you lonely? (Are you lonely?)
        Our fingers dancing when they meet
        You seem so lonely (are you lonely?)
        I'll be the only dream you seek
